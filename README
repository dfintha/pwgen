The pwgen Password Generation Tool
==================================

This program can generate complex passwords for everyday usage, using the
urandom device. By default, without any command-line arguments, it generates a
single, 16 character long password, which can have both upper- and lowercase
letters, numbers, and symbols.

Functionalities of the software include:
- Issuing a warning if generated passwords may be insecure.
- Excluding either lowercase characters, numbers, symbols, or any combination
  of these.
- Excluding a specified character set (for example, Y and Z, as they are often
  at different positions on different keyboards, depending on locale).

For detailed information about the possible command-line arguments, issue the
"pwgen --help" command (without the quotation marks).
